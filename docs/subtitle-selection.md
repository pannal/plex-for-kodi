# How PM4K chooses subtitles

PM4K normally uses the subtitle Plex preselects. If Plex returns subtitle tracks without
marking one selected while your subtitle mode is automatic, PM4K falls back to the first
track in your preferred subtitle language (or the first available track). Manual mode still
selects nothing. PM4K can also turn a subtitle *off* when the **audio** is one of your
**Native languages**. Forced subtitles are never turned off.

So the whole behavior is two inputs combined.

## Input 1 — your Native languages

The audio languages you don't want subtitles for. The list PM4K actually checks is:

- Everything in the **Native languages** setting, **plus**
- Your **Plex Preferred Audio Language**, added automatically **only** when your Plex
  subtitle mode is **"Shown with foreign audio."**

In "Always" and "Manual" modes nothing is added automatically — the list is just the
**Native languages** setting as you typed it (often empty).

> **If you're on "Shown with foreign audio," this won't change what you see.** In that mode
> Plex already hides preferred-audio-language subtitles on its own, so auto-adding your
> Preferred Audio Language here just **mirrors** what Plex is doing — it never *starts*
> hiding subtitles you currently get. It only does real work when you understand **more than
> one** language: Plex has a single preferred-audio slot, so you list the extra languages
> under **Native languages** and PM4K suppresses those too.

> "Native languages" in the tables below means that *effective* list — the setting's
> contents, plus the auto-added Plex audio language in foreign-audio mode.

## Input 2 — what Plex preselects

| Your Plex subtitle mode | Plex preselects |
|---|---|
| Always enabled | A full subtitle |
| Shown with foreign audio | A full subtitle when the audio is foreign; a forced one (if the file has it) when the audio is your preferred language |
| Manual | Nothing (until you pick one) |

If an automatic-mode metadata response unexpectedly has no selected flag, PM4K applies the
fallback above so preplay and playback do not disagree.

## Putting them together

| Plex preselected… | Audio is **not** a Native language | Audio **is** a Native language |
|---|---|---|
| A full subtitle | Kept — **subs on** | Dropped — **no subs** |
| A forced subtitle | Kept | **Kept** (forced never dropped) |
| Nothing | No subs | No subs |

This core table doesn't depend on the mode — the mode only decides *what Plex preselects*.

## Worked examples

- **English speaker, English audio + English subs, Plex on "Always":** Always mode adds
  nothing, so English isn't a Native language → Plex's full English subtitle is kept →
  **subs on, always.**

- **Same, but English added to the Native languages setting:** English *is* a Native
  language → full subtitle dropped → **no subs.** Your own setting overrides Plex's "always."
  (Fix: remove English from Native languages.)

- **A bilingual user — the reason Native languages exists.** Plex stores only **one**
  Preferred Audio Language. Someone who understands both English and Portuguese sets Preferred
  Audio to English with mode **"Shown with foreign audio."** Their Portuguese content's audio
  is always tagged plain `por` (audio codes carry no Brazilian-Portuguese distinction), so
  Plex classifies it as *foreign* and selects a subtitle for it — even though they understand
  it. Plex has no way to be told about the second language; that's an inherent Plex
  limitation. **Fix:** add **Portuguese** to **Native languages**. Now `por` audio is a Native
  language → the subtitle Plex selected is **dropped** → no subs on Portuguese content, while
  genuinely foreign audio still gets subtitles.

  (Aside: the `pt-BR` form only ever appears on *subtitle* preferences, which this logic never
  reads — the audio side this depends on is always plain `por`, so it matches "Portuguese"
  from the picker directly.)

## The things that bend the rules

- **Manual selection holds for the current playback only.** A subtitle you pick *during*
  playback is session-scoped and isn't remembered as a manual choice once you leave —
  re-entering the item re-runs the normal selection above. A subtitle you pick *from preplay*
  sets your Plex default for the item; a subtitle you *download* is added to the item
  server-side. Those two persist, but on the next load they're still subject to the
  Native-languages check like any other preselected track.

- **"Forced subtitles fix" setting.** Works around Plex preselecting a *forced* track when a
  full one is available (regardless of your preference) — with it on, PM4K uses the full
  track instead. It does this only when the audio *isn't* a Native language (its real
  purpose); when the audio *is* a Native language it leaves the forced track alone, so you
  still get the foreign-passage subs. (Inactive unless your Plex forced-subtitle preference
  is "prefer non-forced.")

- **"Forced" means** Plex flagged the track forced, or the word "forced" is in its name.

- **Decided once** — the choice is made at playback start and reused, unless the file or its
  tracks change.

## Known limitations

- **The manual-selection marker is in-memory only.** It protects a hand-picked subtitle
  within the current playback, but it isn't persisted, so it never carries a manual choice
  across re-entering the item.

- **The transcode-decision path doesn't check the manual marker.** Direct-play honours a
  manual pick over the Native-languages check; a transcoded playback (or an in-playback
  rebuild) can still drop a manual full subtitle whose audio is a Native language.
